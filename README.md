**A note on platform:**

This course will be taught in C++ using the Cinder application framework. Course materials were developed primarily for use with XCode, the Mac OS X IDE. Weâ€™ll spend a small amount of time in class looking at XCode itself. However, support can also be provided for students working with Visual Studio in Windows.

An earlier version of this course was taught in Processing. The materials for that course are available at: [AoGP_Fall_2012](https://github.com/Hebali/AoGP_Fall_2012).

**Getting started:**

Clone the course repository (recursively):

`git clone -b master --recursive git://github.com/Hebali/AOGP.git AOGP`

Then build the Cinder submodule:

```
cd AOGP/cinder_master/xcode
./fullbuild.sh 
```
